# Board Game database

This Java project is made with Spring Boot. The application uses MariaDB. The project was originally my final project for the 'Back End Programming' course.

The usage of the application requires logging in as a user or as an admin. Both user types can see the complete list of the board games but only an admin can add, edit or delete items. The application handles errors by showing either a custom "page not found" or "something went wrong" pages.

Screenshots of the project are found on [the screenshots folder](https://github.com/faltzuthewiz/boardgame-database/tree/main/boardgameDatabase/screenshots) .
